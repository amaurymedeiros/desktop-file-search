Instructions for completing Domain Template Version Number: 1.3

****************************************************************


REGISTERING A NEW DOMAIN NAME 

Section 1

* Item 1a: For domain names under .ZA.ORG or ZA.NET insert the name
of the domain you wish to register as in, "EXAMPLE.ZA.ORG". The
total length may be up to 26 characters. The only characters allowed
in a domain name are letters, digits and the dash (-). A domain
name cannot begin or end with a dash. The minimum length of any
third level domain under ZA.NET or ZA.ORG is 3 characters. (ie:
your domain name without .za.net or .za.org appended to it must be
longer than 2 characters.)

* Item 1b: Following the colon, type the word "NEW" to indicate a
new domain name registration.

* Registrant is responsible for the accuracy of name submission; names
will be registered as submitted; any changes will entail an additional
registration fee. 


Section 2 - Domain Name Registrant 

* The domain name is considered to be registered to a "legal entity",
even if the legal entity is an individual (e.g., Lee Smith). Do
not list a "dba" or acronym as the registrant. In this section, it
is important to list the legal name and address of the Registrant,
not the Internet Service Provider ("ISP").

* If Item 2d is not applicable for your country, leave that Item
blank. Items 2a, 2b, 2c and 2e must be completed or the Agreement
will not be accepted.

* Item 2e may be either the country name or two-letter country
code. A list of country codes is available at
"http://www.isi.edu/div7/iana/domain-names.html".


Sections 3 & 4 - Contacts 

* The Administrative Contact/Agent is the person or organisation
authorized by the domain name Registrant to act on behalf of the
legal entity listed in Item 2a. The Administrative Contact/Agent
should be able to answer non-technical questions about the legal
entity's plans for using the domain name and the procedures for
establishing sub-domains.

* Generally, the Technical Contact is the person or organisation
who maintains the domain name Registrant's primary name server,
resolver software, and database files. The Technical Contact person
keeps the name server running and interacts with technical people
in other domains to solve problems that affect the domain name. An
ISP often performs this role.

* Item a - place the name of the Individual or Role being registered.
For Individuals, supply the full name (firstname first, then
lastname) Do not use titles. If suffixes are used, such as "Jr."
or "III", separate the name from the suffix with a comma. For
example, "Public, John Q., III" For Role contacts, provide the full
name, for example, "Customer Service Support Center".

* If you leave all fields in the Technical Contact entry blank it
will be assumed that it should be the same as the Administrative
Contact.  The Administrative Contact is not optional.

Sections 5, 6 & 7 - Name Servers 

* You need at least 2 nameservers configured in order for your
application to be accepted.

* Items a and b must be completed in full. Incomplete information
in Sections 5 and 6 will result in the Agreement being returned.
Section 7 is optional.

* Most ISP's can provide one or more name servers if you do not
have your own. Do not list name servers without the explicit approval
of their owners. The owners of the servers listed must configure
the servers before your domain name will function.

* If possible, name servers should be in physically separate
locations and on different networks.

* Provide the fully-qualified name of the machine that is to be
the name server. For example, use "machinename.domainname.com" not
just "machinename."

The completed form should be mailed to AUTO-DBM@ZA.NET



MODIFYING A DOMAIN NAME RECORD 

* Modifying an existing domain name record is done by "replacement".
This means the contents of various fields in the database are
replaced with new information from the Registration Agreement.

* The spelling of a domain name cannot be changed by submitting a
modification Agreement. If you want a domain name with different
spelling, you must file a New Registration Agreement for the new
domain name and a Delete Registration Agreement when you are ready
to have the old name removed.

Completing the form is the same as for a NEW request, Item 1b should
read MODIFY.

The completed form should be mailed to AUTO-DBM@ZA.NET and MUST
originate from a current, VALID contact for the domain.


DELETING A DOMAIN NAME 

* A request that comes from the Registrant or the Administrative
Contact/Agent will be honored, providing any security constraints
are met.

* Notification of a completed deletion request will be sent to the
contacts currently listed.

* A request that comes from an ISP currently providing name service
for the domain name may result in the name being placed on hold.

* If the request comes from none of the above, and does not meet
any security established for the contacts, it will be returned for
further explanation of the relationship between the requester and
Registrant.  The Administrative Contact/Agent and the Technical
Contact will be notified.

* If an ISP removes name service, the domain name may be placed on
"hold". "Hold" means that the domain name will be visible via
"whois" but cannot be used.

Completing the form is the same as for a NEW request, Item 1b should
read DELETE.

The completed form should be mailed to AUTO-DBM@ZA.NET
