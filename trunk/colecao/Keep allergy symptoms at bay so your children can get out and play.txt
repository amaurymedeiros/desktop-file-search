(ARA) - Allergy season can have your children huddling inside the house with runny noses, itchy eyes and heavy sneezing. It's a sight no parent wants to see since this is the time of year the weather makes children want to play outside.

"Preventing or reducing allergy symptoms is entirely possible if you avoid your allergy triggers and work with your doctor to treat the symptoms," says Dr. Tanya Remer Altmann, mother, pediatrician and author.

"No parent wants to keep an active child indoors when the sun is shining and everyone is outside," Altmann says. "And, no parent wants to see her child feeling miserable. There are plenty of ways to help your children enjoy the summer months and still reduce allergy symptoms like sneezing and itchy, runny noses."

"Dr. Tanya," as she is known on the "Today" show and through her blog, provides the following tips to help your children keep allergy symptoms at bay so they'll be outside in no time.

* During the peak allergy season, enjoy indoor activities, such as museums, libraries or indoor play areas.

* Runny noses can become sore very quickly, so use a lotioned tissue like Puffs Plus with Lotion to help prevent and reduce tenderness. In addition to soothing your children's noses, teach them to blow their noses correctly. Ask your child to blow as if they were blowing out a candle through their nose with their mouth closed. This visual will help your child to remember to blow gently, which is key.

* Keep your car and home windows closed to help keep airborne pollens away.

* Minimize playtime outside early in the day when pollen counts are highest. Have your children plan indoor activities during the earlier hours, and schedule any outdoor sporting activities later in the day.

* Teach your children to wash their hands and faces after playing outside. Many experts advise teaching children to sing the ABC song, or "Row Your Boat" to help them understand how long they need to keep the soap and water on their hands to get them thoroughly cleaned. You can also have them take a shower - washing their hair - and put on clean clothes after coming in from the outdoors. This is especially important to do before bedtime.

* If your child has been diagnosed with specific allergies, consider placing a High Efficiency Particulate Arrestor (HEPA) air filter in their bedroom to help them sleep more comfortably at night.

With your children's allergy symptoms prevented or reduced, you and your children can get outside and enjoy the warm temperatures in the great outdoors. For additional helpful advice on allergies and prevention tips, visit www.puffs.com.
